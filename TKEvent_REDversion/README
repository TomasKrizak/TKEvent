TKEvent (RED version) is an extension to RED data format. Add TKEvent.cc, TKEvent.hh and all scripts using them to all your other scripts working with RED data. 

If you want to create your 3D interactive model of an event, you first have to call function "build_event_3D" on a TKEvent object which creates a root file with detector geometry and important event data. Then you can run visu.cpp with your root (you can do it from your own computer) to visualize that event.

I have included two example scripts (double_beta_finder.cxx, test.cxx) showing the usage of this class.
